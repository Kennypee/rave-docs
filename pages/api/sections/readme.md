# API Keys
## This section describes what API keys are and how to obtain them.

Rave authenticates your API requests using your account’s API keys. If you do not include your key when making an API request, or use one that is incorrect or outdated, Rave returns an error.
All API requests exist in either test or live mode, and one mode cannot be manipulated by data in the other. To get your  API keys you need to sign up for Rave here.


## There are two types of API keys: publishable and secret.


- Publishable API keys are meant solely to identify your account with Rave, they aren’t secret. In other words, they can safely be published in places like your Rave JavaScript code, or in an Android or iPhone app. Publishable keys only have the power to create a transaction. An example of a publishable API Key can be seen below:
