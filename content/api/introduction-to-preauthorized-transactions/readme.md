## Introduction to Preauthorized Transactions
 
Card preauthorization allows a merchant preauthorize a specific amount to be paid by a customer. Once preauthorized successfully, a `hold` is put on the `amount specified`, and left for the merchant to `capture` that amount at a later time or date. Merchants after preauthorizing can perform the following actions:

  - Void: This allows the merchant release the hold on the funds i.e. if value was not given for the service, the merchant would typically be required to void the transaction.
  - Refund: This allows the merchant refund a `preauthorized amount` or `captured amount`.
  - Capture: This allows a merchant capture or collect the preauthorized funds from the customer i.e. after value or service has been given to the customer a merchant would capture the preauthorized amount.


> NOTE  :  Once an amount is preauthorized on a card and not captured within `Seven (7) working days`, the hold on the funds is removed or `voided`
