## Create A Rave Account

The first step is to sign up with Flutterwave for a Rave account. Below are the two types of accounts on the Rave’s platform with their descriptions.

| Sandbox Account   | Choose this account if you’re a developer and you need a testing environment that isolates untested code changes and outright experimentation from the production environment or repository. | https://ravesandbox.flutterwave.com/                             |
| Live Account      | Choose this account if you’re a merchant and you want to accept payments directly to your bank account.                                                                                      | [**https://rave.flutterwave.com**](https://rave.flutterwave.com) |
