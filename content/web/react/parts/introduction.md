# Integrating Rave with React

Rave allows you to receive local and international payments via card, bank account, and USSD. The beauty of having these different payment options is that it lets your customers pay you seamlessly.
This section will walk you through the steps you can take to integrate Rave with your React application. [React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. When you are through with this integration, you should be able to do the following:

1. Setup a test (sandbox) and live account on Rave.
2. Retrieve your public and secret key.
3. Successfully integrate Rave on any React project or application.
4. Successfully accept payments from your customers using Rave.
5. Successfully verify a payment and give your customer value.
6. Understand articles and blog posts written on securing online payments.

By proceeding with this integration it is assumed that you have at least basic knowledge of the following:

1. React
2. React Router
3. NodeJS and NPM
