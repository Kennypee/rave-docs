To create a React application, navigate to your terminal and input the following commands:

> CAUTION: This procedure assumes you are familiar with and have installed the following:

>1. NodeJS
>2. NPM

```
# install the create-react-app cli globally
$ npm install -g create-react-app
    
# create a new project by running the create-react-app command

Your `package.json` file should  include `react` , `react-dom`,  `react-scripts`  and  `react-toastify` as dependencies. You may install other dependencies that you may need with `NPM`:

```
$ npm install --save <NAME OF DEPENDENCY>
```

Alternatively,  you may use Yarn:

``` 
$ yarn add <NAME OF DEPENDENCY>
```
