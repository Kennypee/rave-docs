# Integrating Rave with Flask

Rave allows you to receive local and international payments via card, bank account and USSD. The beauty of having these different payment options is that it lets your customers pay you seamlessly.

This section will walk you through integrating Rave with Flask. [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is an extensible microframework used to build web applications with Python. The aim of this integration is to enable you perform the following:


1. Setup a test(sandbox) and live account on Rave.
2. Retrieve your public and secret key.
3. Successfully integrate Rave on any Flask project or application.
4. Successfully accept payments from your customers using Rave.
5. Successfully verify a payment and give your customer value.
6. Understand articles and blog posts written on securing online payments.


By proceeding with this integration it is assumed that you have at least basic knowledge of the following:


1. Python
2. Pip
3. Flask
