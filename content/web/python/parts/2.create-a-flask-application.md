## Create a Flask Application

The first step to building a Flask application is to check if you have Python installed in your system. You can do this by navigating to your terminal and typing the following command:

If you don’t have Python on your system, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 



When you’re done installing Python, create a directory for you Rave project:

After creating the directory, install Flask and other libraries:

Installing Flask also installs a few dependencies which you can view when you run the following command:

The dependencies listed above can be saved in a file. This is good practice because anyone who wants to work on or run your project will need to know the dependencies to install. The following command will save the dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file:

When you’re done installing the required libraries, navigate to your project folder. Here we’ll proceed to arrange our project’s sub-folders and files in the following format:

`/app` :  This is a directory within your project folder. Here we’ll put all or code and leave out other files such as the `requirements.txt`  file outside.
`/app/templates` :  This is where we’ll put our HTML files.
`/app/static` :  This is where we’ll put static files such as CSS and JavaScript files as well as images.
