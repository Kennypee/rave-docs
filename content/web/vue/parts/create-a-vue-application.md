## Create a Vue Application

The best way to integrate Vue to your Rave application would be to use Vueâ€™s command line interface (CLI). To carry this out, navigate to your terminal and enter the following commands:

> CAUTION: This procedure assumes you are familiar with and have installed the following:

> 1. NodeJS
> 2. Webpack or Browserify

    # install Vue globally
    $ npm install -g vue-cli  
    
    # create a new project using the Webpack template
    $ vue init webpack my-rave-project
    
    # or if you prefer using the Browserify template
    $ vue init browserify my-rave-project
    
    # install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder
    $ cd my-rave-project
    $ npm install
    
    # Start the app
    $ npm run dev

In creating this project, Webpack was used.  When initializing your project using the Webpack template, you will have to answer a few questions. Use the image below as a guide:

When you are done, your application folder should have a structure similar to this:

Your `package.json` file should  include `vue`  and  `vue-router`  as dependencies. You may install other dependencies that you may need with `NPM`:

    $ npm install --save <NAME OF DEPENDENCY>

Alternatively,  you may use Yarn:

    $ yarn add <NAME OF DEPENDENCY>
