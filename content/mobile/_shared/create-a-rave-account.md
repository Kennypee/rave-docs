## Create a Rave Account

The first step is to sign up with Flutterwave for a Rave account. Below are the two types of accounts on the Rave platform and their descriptions.

| RAVE ACCOUNT TYPE | LINK                                                         | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                  | LINK                                                             |

| Sandbox Account   | https://ravesandbox.flutterwave.com/                         | Choose this account if you’re a developer and you need a testing environment that isolates untested code changes and outright experimentation from the production environment or repository. | [**http://rave.frontendpwc.com**](http://rave.frontendpwc.com)   |
| Live Account      | [https://rave.flutterwave.com](https://rave.flutterwave.com) | Choose this account if you’re a merchant and you want to accept payments directly to your bank account.                                                                                      | [**https://rave.flutterwave.com**](https://rave.flutterwave.com) |


You could also opt for the subdomain feature as it  enhances technical implementation and search engine optimization.
