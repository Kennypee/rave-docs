## Create Android Project
Android Studio

### Android Studio

To add Rave to your project is seamless and very simple, takes less than 5 minutes on the average. You don’t have to clone any repo or install any external files, simply open Android Studio and create your project. Add this maven repository to your project level build.gradle file (Project Module):


    allprojects {
        repositories {
           .....
            maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        }
    }

Then click sync. Next add this dependency to your app level build.gradle file (Application Module):


    
    compile 'com.github.Flutterwave:rave-android:1.0.16'
    

Again click the visible sync button and BOOOOM!!! you have Rave installed. 

### Permissions

Now that you have installed Rave, lets add its required permissions. This library requires the `READ_PHONE_STATE` to get the build number for fraud detection and flagging as recommended [here](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids.html#i_abuse_detection_detecting_high_value_stolen_credentials).
So open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add these permissions:


     
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
     
     <uses-permission android:name="android.Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
     


## Setup Rave

Assuming you’ve signed up using a sandbox account, login to your **Ravepay** Dashboard and at the sidebar, click on **Setup Rave**.

When you click on **Setup Rave**,  you will be shown a options through which you can start collecting payments:

Since we are Integrating Rave with Kotlin, how to accept payments with Rave in our custom applications should be our concern here so select the Custom App and continue.
