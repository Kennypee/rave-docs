# Testing

Testing is a crucial part of setting up integrations, verily you’ll want to be certain that you don’t misguide your customers or have them make payments to the wrong account. Most importantly, testing halps you verify that our modal supports all the cards your users could be paying with. 

To this effect, we have set up test cards that’ll help you try out varying card types on your modal and confirm payments before deployment of your app. To test these cards on the project we’ve set up above, you’ll need to do a few things:

First sign up on the rave sandbox environment here to get your test keys (public and secret). Next, update the Rave Pay Manager `.setSecretKey()` and `.setPublicKey()` methods with the new test keys. Finally upadate the  `onStagingEnv()` method and set it to true:


    
    .setPublicKey("your_publicKey -from_sandbox")
    .setSecretKey("your_secretKey -from_sandbox")
    .onStagingEnv(true)
    

Now to test it out, visit our [Test Card](http://Intent testCards = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("https://flutterwavedevelopers.readme.io/docs/test-cards"));) section and input the provided card details when you run your app
