## Create a Rave Account

The first step is to sign up with Flutterwave for a Rave account. Below are the two types of accounts on the Rave platform and their descriptions.

| RAVE ACCOUNT TYPE | LINK                                                         | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                  | LINK                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sandbox Account   | https://ravesandbox.flutterwave.com/                         | Choose this account if you’re a developer and you need a testing environment that isolates untested code changes and outright experimentation from the production environment or repository. | [**http://rave.frontendpwc.com**](http://rave.frontendpwc.com)   |
| Live Account      | [https://rave.flutterwave.com](https://rave.flutterwave.com) | Choose this account if you’re a merchant and you want to accept payments directly to your bank account.                                                                                      | [**https://rave.flutterwave.com**](https://rave.flutterwave.com) |



You could also opt for the subdomain feature as it  enhances technical implementation and search engine optimization.

### **Create Android Project**
**Android Studio**

To add rave to your project is seamless and very simple, takes less than 5 minutes on the average. You don’t have to clone any repo or install any external file, simple add this maven repository to your project level build.gradle file (Project Module):


    allprojects {
        repositories {
           .....
            maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        }
    }

Then click sync. Next add this dependency to your app level build.gradle file (Application Module):


    
    compile 'com.github.Flutterwave:rave-android:1.0.16'
    

Again click the visible sync button and BOOOOM!!! you have rave installed. 

### Permissions

Now that you have rave, lets add it’s required permissions, this library requires the `READ_PHONE_STATE` to get the build number for fraud detection and flagging as recommended [here](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids.html#i_abuse_detection_detecting_high_value_stolen_credentials).
So open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add these permissions:


     
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
     
     <uses-permission android:name="android.Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
