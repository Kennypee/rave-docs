## Step 5: Install Rave Payment

To install Rave, you’ll have to navigate back to your project folder but since the project is already running in `cmd`, you won’t be able to navigate back at least, not in the same window (this is why we require Git). Hence, right click on your Desktop and select “Git Bash Here” it’ll open a bash window for you to navigate into the **Cordova-Rave > hello** folder and then run this command to install Rave payment


    //  ~/Desktop/Cordova-Rave
    
    cd hello
    
    // ~/Desktop/Cordova-Rave/hello
    
    $ npm install cordova-rave
    


This installs the Rave payment package to your project. Having installed it, let’s go ahead and configure it.
