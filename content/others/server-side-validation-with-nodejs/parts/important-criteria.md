## Check out the important criteria to observe when validating the payment on the server side:

1. Verify the transaction reference.
2. Verify the status of the transaction to be a success.
3. Verify that a charge response `chargeResponse` found in `response.data.flwMeta` has the value `00` or `0`.
4. Verify that the currency is the expected currency to accept payments in.
5. Most importantly verify the stipulated amount paid to be equal to the amount of value given.


> CAUTION : On Rave it is advised your complete a status check for every transaction using the unique transaction reference (`flwRef`) generated by the gateway. Should it be absolutely necessary you use your own unique transaction reference to perform a status check, you must ensure that your transaction reference is unique for every transaction.
