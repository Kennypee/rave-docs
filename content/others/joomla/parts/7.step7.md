## Step 7: Module Configuration

**Create a payment form**

Now that we have the global configurations for the payment forms set, lets go ahead and create a payment form with the Rave Payment Forms Module:

Click on **Extensions** and select **Modules** from the top menu. From the list of created module instances, an unpublished form was created from the installation. This can be used or you can create another form by clicking the green **New** button at the top left of the page and selecting **Rave Payment Forms** from the list of module types

**Form parameters**


- **Title** - (**Required**) The title of the form you want to create. The title can be hidden from the view by clicking hide button on the "Show Title" option on the right of the page.
- **Module**: tab contains form specific configuration:
  - **Amount**: The amount to charge the customer (if left blank, customer will be asked to enter amount).
  - **Use logged in user email**: Uses logged-in user's email as customer email when set to ‘YES’ (If set to 'No', customer will be asked to enter email).
  - **Button Text** - (**Optional**) The text to display on the form button. Default: "PAY NOW".
  - Other options (on the right):
    - **Position**: Set the position (place) to display the form on your site. This is dependent on the current template position. But, the module provides an extra position named **Rave In-Article**: and can be selected from the list. This lets you display the form on an article page (more below). Also, you can set (enter) a custom position.
    - **Status**: The status of the form. Set to **Published** to have the form available for display.
- **Menu Assignment**: tab lets you select the page(s) that will have access to the form. "No pages" means the form won't be available. Recommended is "On all pages". You can use "Only on the pages selected" to restrict the form to certain pages (pages need to exist).
- Click **Save & Close** to create (or save) the form.


**Complete** **F****orm** **C****reation** 

After configuring the settings above, navigate to the upper left side of the page and click the “Save” button to complete the payment form creation.

Now your form is available to receive payment “on all pages” or on “selected pages” depending on what you set on the Menu Assignment tab in the Module. Next lets define how your payment form is displayed.
